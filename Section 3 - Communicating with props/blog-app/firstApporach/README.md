# Blog App - Naive approach

For this approach, everything will be developed in one single component. This is not a good way to create compoenents as it does not follow proper design patters, division of responsabilities and much of the code is copy pasted and hardcoded.

However, this aproach is just an introduction and first-look on props and real React application development.
